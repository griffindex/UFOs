## Summary:
- A drawback of this webpage is that it's not clear which dates are available to parse.
- The date label could be edited to note that this table only contains data from 1/1/2010 - 1/13/2010.
- Another recommended modication would be removing the country filter since all of the data pertains to cities and states within the United States.
- One last improvement would be to add a list or menu for the user to see which cities and states are available to filter.

Overall this webpage provides a simple interface for filtering through the provided javascript file and can be expanded with more data to draw conclusions about UFO sightings.
